                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I grew up in a small town just outside Vancouver, Canada. I‚Äôve lived in Montreal and Toronto but have called London my home for the last 8 years. Currently, I work at a startup called Applied as an Operations Manager. Before my current job I used to work in coffee as a professional barista and then moved into the charity sector where I trained vulnerable adults and project managed opening charity shops across London.
                        <br>I spend most of my free time running, cycling, swimming and going to the movies. I have an unhealthy relationships with podcasts and will most likely recommend you at least one.</p>

            <p>I started thinking about changing careers a few years ago. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time taking short courses, reading, listening, and watching videos on where I want my work-life to go next. I‚Äôve researched and talked to a few people who have done bootcamps in London and a handful of engineers who have works with FAC alumni. From all of that research it became clear that the learning environment that FAC provides will be best for me. This is a combination of 1. learning in person 2. learning with others closely (paird programming) 3. being able to learn on the job. </p>

        <h1 id="whydev">Why Software Development?</h1>
        <p>The question more for me is why didn‚Äôt I do this 8 years ago? When I was living in Toronto in 2013/2014 I went to a few meetups with Ladies Learning Code and also did an intro HTML and CSS course at one of the arts universities. I think I‚Äôm at a stage in my life where I have the maturity and self-awareness to make a career change and really throw myself into it.
            <br>For a long time I believed that what I liked doing was process oriented. In reality, what I like doing is making things. I‚Äôve spend most of my working life trying to make the world more accessible and I‚Äôd like to try my hand at doing that in software development.</p>
