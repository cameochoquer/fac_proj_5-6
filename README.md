# Application Website

This website page is the penultimate project as part of my application to FAC.

## Description
This page has three main sections that use flexbox: about me, why fac and why software development. 
It has a header and a footer that guide the user out of the main page. 

On previous project pages there is a button or icon that redirects the user to the next project in the application.

## planning 
overall outline of projects and tasks managed on Notion
wireframe using miro [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOm_dBOI=/)

## how it was built
I knew I wanted to use flexbox, have a graph background, a carousel, and use shapes with primary colours. 
I relied on w3schools to build the collapsable 'hot takes' button as I didn't want to repeat project 2. 
I also relied heavily on w3schools to create the carousel, meaning I did not make it from scratch.


## Future Improvements <sub><sub> or what I would've done with more time </sub></sub>
- fitting text inside the graphs
- fixed background 
- fixed and local shapes with primary colours in the background 
- bracket javascript feature [like this](https://blog.codepen.io/2018/02/16/need-make-tournament-bracket/) for Project 6
- better spacing between flexboxes on mobile 
- fix collapsable text so that carousel doesn't move alongside
- replace navigation text with icons from previous project icons
